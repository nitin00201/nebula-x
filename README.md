 Design Decisions

Apple-style layout: Large hero images, subtle gradients, clean sans-serif typography (Poppins).

Responsive-first: Flex-based layouts with flex-wrap, max-w, and gap ensure mobile and desktop compatibility.

No card overuse: Some sections intentionally avoid Shadcn cards for a more free-flowing layout (e.g., AR features).
